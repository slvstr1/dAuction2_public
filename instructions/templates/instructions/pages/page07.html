            Retailers need to buy units from Producers. Retailers also are allowed to trade: they may buy, but also sell
            units. At the end of {{ spot_market }}, Retailers must hold a total of units at least equal to UNITS DEMANDED.
            Retailers will be credited the net trading revenues which will be shown in Experimental Currency Units
            (ECUs){% if not treatment.only_spot %} as calculated over {{ forward_market }} and {{ spot_market }}{% endif %}.
            <br><br>
            Retailers will also receive earnings for holding units at the end of the round. They will be credited with
            <strong>{{ treatment.retail_price }}</strong> ECUs for each unit that satisfies UNITS DEMANDED. Retailers
            receive no credits for units they hold in excess of UNITS DEMANDED. See Table 2 for the Retailers' earnings.
