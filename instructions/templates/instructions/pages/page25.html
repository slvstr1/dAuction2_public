                At the top, to the right of the Earnings Overview, is the Transaction Overview. In this overview, each
                line
                represents a transaction, with the topline showing the most recent transaction. The transactions are
                numbered (#) and the higher the number, the more recent the transaction. Sales, with a red (or, in
                print, dark gray) background, always have a positive number of Units and purchases, with a blue (or, in
                print, light gray) background, a negative number.
                <br><br>
                Thus, the Transaction Overview of the Retailer in the example in Figure 14 would look as in Figure 15
                and it
                can be seen that the Retailer, with the last transaction, spend a Total of 40 ECU by buying 10 Units for a Price per Unit of 4 ECU, and, with the transaction before that, earned a Total of 24 ECU by selling 8 Units for a Price per Unit of 3 ECU, and so on.

                Under the Transaction Overview is the Profit Overview. It shows the Total Earnings, the Total Trading
                Revenues, and the PROFIT. If a {% if treatment.require_units_demanded_on_PR %}participant{% else %}Retailer{% endif %} received penalties, they will also be shown here. For the
                Retailer in the example, the Profit Overview looks as in Figure 16
                <br><br>

                The Total Earnings is thus the total Earnings resulting from the Units Bought. The Total Trading
                Revenues is
                the total earnings (if positive) or total costs (if negative) from trading (selling and buying). The
                PROFIT
                is then equal to the Total Earnings plus the Total Trading Revenues and, if there are any, minus the
                penalties.
                <br><br>
                Note that the Profit Overview follows the previous example. The Retailer incurred Total Earnings from
                the 7
                Units that were bought in Figure 14.e (Total Earn(ings) are 7 x {{ treatment.retail_price }}
                = {% widthratio treatment.retail_price 1 7 %}) and obtained the Total Trading Revenues
                from the payments for Units when trading. The Total Trading Revenue of -19 ECU can be obtained by adding
                the
                totals in the Transaction Overview in Figure 15 (-40 + 24 + 4 â€“ 7 = -19 ECU).Please inspect Figure 15 to
                verify that.
